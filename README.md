A minimalistic, responsive portfolio website designed in **black, white & magenta**.  
Built entirely with **vanilla HTML & CSS**, this site showcases my profile, experience, selected projects, and contact information.

Deployed live on Netlify and automatically updates when I push changes to the repository.
